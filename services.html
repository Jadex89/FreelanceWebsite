    <h1>Services & Pricing</h1><br>
    
<p>These are the services I offer, just to give you an idea of what each one entails and also the corresponding rate. I would rather not charge per hour as I find this a little unfair. Each text is different and, as I also accept work from all over the world, I don't want to discriminate in any way by charging more to edit the text of a non-English person (which, depending on level, could require more work and subsequently take extra time).</p>

<p>I work via Word or Google Docs and always use tracked changes.</p>
<p>If you would like any more information regarding my services or rates, please contact me and I will be happy to help.</p><br>
    <h3>Copy/line editing</h3>
    <p>
This is the first part of the editing process and consists of checking the text for any grammatical, spelling or punctuation errors. Word choice and formatting will also be looked at. All suggestions will be provided via tracked changes.
    </p>
    <p class="price">£0.01 per word</p>
    
    <h3>Proofreading</h3>
    <p>
This is the last part of the editing process and is completed once the main copy/line editing process has been done. This consists of checking through the text again to look for any missed errors and some final polishing to ensure the text is ready for publishing.
    </p>
    <p class="price"> £0.005 per word</p>
    <h3>Beta reading</h3>
    <p>
This is for pilot reading your text as a general reader, checking for readability and providing feedback on the story. You are more than welcome to use this as a testimonial or review for your sales page. I will provide this free of charge with my editing services but as a standalone project, there will be a charge to cover my time.
    </p>
    <p class="price"> £50</p>

   <p>Please note, there will be a minimum charge of £25. </p>
   <p>Returning clients will be eligible for a 10% discount.</p>
   <p>The rates above are based on my standard turnaround time. All projects will require a 10% deposit, and the remaining balance payable within 30 days of invoicing.</p><br><br>
