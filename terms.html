<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

<p>The terms and conditions outlined below apply to any work undertaken by myself, as ‘JC Editing’ (of www.jc-editing.co.uk), on behalf of you, the ‘client’ (terms may be used interchangeably throughout this document).</p>

<p>The services offered are proofreading, copy/line editing and beta reading. These services will be provided after both parties (JC Editing and the client) have both mutually come to an agreement in writing.</p>

<p>The client is under no obligation to offer me work, nor am I under any obligation to accept work offered by the client.</p>

<p>The work will be carried out by myself only, and never sub-contracted out to any third parties.</p>

<p>The work will be carried out unsupervised at such times and places as determined by myself, using my own equipment.</p>

<p>Whilst I can’t 100% guarantee that I won’t miss any errors, the editing done by myself will always be aiming for the highest of standards.</p>

<h3>Project Terms</h3>

<ul>Prior to commencement of the work, the client and I will discuss and agree, in writing, to the terms of the project:<br><br>
    <li>The medium in which the proofreading/editing service will be carried out (Word or Google Docs)</li>
    <li>The desired turnaround time</li>
    <li>The length of time required to complete the project, as advised by me</li>
    <li>A fee for the project, based on a quotation supplied by me, in writing, following my evaluation of the material to be proofread/edited and the time frame required to complete the job</li>
    <li>The deposit to be paid and received before the project is commenced.</li></ul>
      
<p>Please note that if, on receipt of the project to be worked on (or at an early stage), it becomes apparent that significantly more work is required than had been anticipated in the preliminary discussion/brief or from the sample supplied, I may renegotiate the fee and/or the deadline, or decline to carry out the work.</p>

<h3>Fees and Payment</h3>

<p>The client will pay me a fee per hour OR per word OR an agreed flat fee for the job, according to prior agreement.</p>

<p>Once the client and I have agreed the full fee, it is non-negotiable, unless the client extends the word count of the job or requests additional services. In this case, a revised quotation and job-completion date will be negotiated.</p>

<p>A non-refundable deposit of 10% is to be paid upon signing the contract and before the work is started, unless otherwise agreed.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise agreed, I will supply the client with an invoice immediately upon completion of the proofreading/editing project.</p>

<p>Payment should be received within 30 days of invoicing, as set out in the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 – Amended and Supplemented in 2002.
Payments can be made via bank transfer, PayPal or Square.</p>

<h3>Cancellation</h3>

      <p>The client has a right to cancel a service for any reason, and at any time, by providing me with written notice.</p>

<p>If the request to cancel the service is received during the editing/proofreading process, I reserve the right to invoice for 100% of the agreed fee, less any advanced payment except for the deposit, which is non-refundable.</p>

<p>If the request to cancel the service is received one week or more before commencing the work, no further fees will be payable.</p>
      
      <p>The client is obligated to pay a fee proportionate to the amount of work already completed (if any), chargeable at the per-word rate.</p>

<p>If I am touched by extraordinary or difficult circumstances that cause cancellation (e.g. bereavement), I will contact the client in writing at the earliest opportunity and do my best to renegotiate the time frame of the project or find an alternative supplier of proofreading/editing services. Any advance payment will be refunded.</p>

      <p>Both the client and I have the right to terminate a contract for services at any time if there is a serious breach of its terms.</p>

<p>JC Editing can terminate a contract at any time and for any reason, including but not limited to: document is unintelligible, document is not in English, non-payment of fees due; aggressive, abusive or inappropriate behaviour. Upon notice being given to you of the termination of the contract, you would be required to pay all sums due.</p>

<h3>Post Completion</h3>

<p>The invoice will be sent out straight away upon completion and the client will be given up to 30 days to pay it in full.</p>

</p>I may use your name and link to your book’s sales page, screenshot of your book cover or any screenshots of my work on the project on my website and social media. If you do not want me to do this, please let me know.</p>
<p>I will keep a backup copy of your work (unless asked otherwise), both original and edited, for at least six months securely in case of failure with your own system, or to revert back if any changes are requested by yourself at a later date.</p>
<p>If you are unsatisfied by the completed work after completion, please notify me in writing, giving the reasons why, and I will do my utmost to rectify them (included in the cost). </p>

<h3>Copyright, Confidentiality and Privacy</h3>


<p>All content delivered to me by the client for the proofreading/editing project is owned by the Client.</p>

<p>Following payment of my invoice, any content created by me as part of the proofreading/editing process will become the copyright of the client unless otherwise agreed.</p>

<p>The nature and content of the work will be kept confidential and not made known to anyone other than the client and JC Editing without prior written permission.</p>

<p>Under the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998, the client and I may keep on record such information (e.g. contact details) as is necessary. Either may view the other’s records to ensure that they are relevant, correct and up to date.</p>

<p>Please see my <a href="./privacy-policy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> page for information on the data I collect and how information is used or stored.</p>
