<p class="about">
    Hello, everyone!<br><br>

I’d first like to introduce myself.<br><br>
I’m Jade, the editor, owner and creator of JC Editing. I’m a UK national, born and raised, an English degree holder, and an achiever of a recently completed 'Proofreading and Editing' course.
<br><br>
I’ve always had a passion for creative writing and a fondness for English literature, so I have studied it pretty much all of my life so far. As well as studying literature and reading in my spare time, I’ve also been a hobby writer. I’ve written for my own blog website in the past as well as enjoyed extensive collaborative creative writing with people from other parts of the world, which started as fan fiction as a young teen. I’ve usually been the one in my family that gets sent copies of relatives’ CVs to edit or proofread and that was long before I became an editor.
<br><br>
It just made perfect sense to let it become my career. 
<br><br>
My services include copy/line editing, proofreading and also beta reading. I can use both Google Docs or a Word Processor to complete the assignment, and both will consist of thorough grammatical and spelling errors, including punctuation and choice of word suggestions. If my copy or line editing service is purchased, I will add beta reading free of charge and provide feedback on the story and readability as a whole.
<br><br>
I have experience editing novels, standalone chapters, short stories, job applications and CVs, paraphrasing and website content. I also have experience working with non-UK native clients and those with English as a second language.
